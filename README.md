Steps 
1. Game Board Representation
Decide how you'll represent the game board. This could be a 3x3 grid, a matrix, or a list of lists, depending on your programming language and preferences.

2. Display the Game Board
Create a function to display the game board to the players. This could be a simple console output or a graphical user interface if you're building a desktop or mobile app.

3. Player Input
Prompt the players to input their moves. Handle input validation to ensure the move is valid (e.g., within the grid and on an empty space).

4. Update the Game State
After each move, update the game state to reflect the new board configuration. Check for win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) or a draw.

5. Switch Players
Alternate between players after each valid move. Keep track of whose turn it is.

6. Determine Win/Loss/Draw
Continuously check for win conditions after each move. If a player wins, display a message and end the game. If the board fills up without a winner, declare a draw.

7. Play Again
Prompt the players if they want to play again. Reset the game board if they agree.
